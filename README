I talked about the ex with Guy Katz, Yair Shemer, Itay Tayar and Ortal Glatt.

In the exercise this week we built an "asteroids" game.
The goal was to continue to practice object counter programming,
to implement complete software with all departments and their relationship.

###############################
#     General structure-      #
###############################

The basic class is an "object" that gives each object in the game the most
basic attributes.
From "object" class inherits three classes - "ship", "asteroid" and "torpedo".
Each of them has other unique features.

The other object is GameRunner Which is a game.
The game class has a main function that is a loop of the game,
which runs repeatedly at constant speed, and inside the loop there is a call
to all the functions that need to occur in each loop.

Loop calls are divided into moving and drawing all the objects,
navigating and shooting the ship, checking the collision of the ship and
testing the torpedo attack on the asteroid.
Finally - check if the game is over.

###############################
#        special shot-        #
###############################

I chose to use a special shot that selects a nearby asteroid and changes the
speed so that it tries to follow it.
Type of "heat-guided missile".

The special missile is a separate object that inherits from the torpedo class.

The missile searches every 20 loops for new asteroid to follow, and each 5
loops updates its speed by the position of the tracked asteroid.

All the tests that I added for the special shot may slow the running of the
program a bit and therefore it is worth examining it even
without the special shot.

###############################
#    Design Considerations    #
###############################

1. In the special missile, all the actions he makes (to look for a new
    asteroid each loop, and update the speed) slowed down the program very much
    and caused a uneven and non-continuous flight of the torpedo.

    I could have left the asteroid update and speed each loop, and so the
    missile was more than accurate and hit better.

    but I decided to look for a new asteroid just every 20 loops and update
    every 5 speed, that way the program works better, and the missile's
    flight was uniform.

2. At first, I defined the speed of the special missile, in the same formula
    as the standard missile (to the speed size)

    But after a few games, with the special missile, I saw that the game became
    too easy because every missile hits the asteroid and there is no challenge.

    I could leave it as it was, and give the missile the speed it allowed.
    But I chose to limit the size of the speed to 4.5, So the game would be
    interesting.

3. Another change I would make, is to limit the speed.

    In the current situation, after a short press of increasing the speed,
    the speed has become too high and the user loses control of the ship.

    In my opinion, the speed of the ship should have been limited, and that is
    how I designed the game, but I was told that it is not allowed in the
    exercise settings, so I lowered the restriction .
